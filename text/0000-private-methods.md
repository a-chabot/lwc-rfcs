# Private Methods for Lightning Web Components

## Summary 
The goal of this project is to enable [native private method support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_elements) into LWC. Private methods are created by using a # prefix and cannot be referenced outside of the declared class. This provides secure encapsulation. Elements and methods marked as private are not part of the typical inheritance chain and thus cannot be accessed by subclasses. The focus is explicitly only private methods, not private properties due to the [challenges outlined here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBiBU02ZZewwrigd4goxWGj6soV_wMZUaYkh5gKwSG0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lfham11h83gz). 

## Basic Example
To convert a method to be private, simply add a hash (`#`) before the method declaration:
```javascript
publicMethod() { ... }
#privateMethod() { ... }
```

Private methods can be referenced using dot notation: 
```javascript
this.publicMethod();
this.#privateMethod();
```

## Motivation
The largest motivation for this feature is improving our security approach. Hackerforce have been able to find many security exploits that focus on context abuse and method overriding. These vulnerabilities enable the execution of malicious code in system mode. 

While the immediate issues have been addressed, the implemented solutions are only mitigating some vulnerabilities. Numerous other vulnerabilities persist within the Base Components repository, and likely in other first party components. Implementing private methods in LWC will provide a more comprehensive and robust solution.

This solution is necessary because first-party components (1P components) are not run in Lightning Web Security (LWS). Second and third party components are already secure from these vulnerabilities because of the encapsulation that LWS provides. 

## Detailed Design 
The following design proposal is known as the “Trojan Horse Strategy”.

If you were to try using a private method in an LWC today, it will fail with an error from [@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties](https://github.com/salesforce/lwc/blob/master/packages/%40lwc/compiler/src/transformers/javascript.ts) (referred to as babel-ptcp in the rest of this document).

To implement private methods, the proposed solution involves transforming the method call both BEFORE and AFTER babel-ptcp. 

At the start, user code will look something like:
```javascript
#privateMethodCall() { ... }
```

We will transform that method declaration, via a own newly written babel transform, to look like: 
```javascript
_internal_only_private_privateMethodCall()
```

Then it will go through the babel-ptcp. Since babel-ptcp does not see this as a private method, rather a regular method, it will not throw an error. 

Then the method name will be transformed back to match its original name, via another newly written babel transform: 
```javascript
#privateMethodCall() { ... }
```

This approach delegates to native browser behavior of private methods and is a backwards compatible solution. [You can find a POC PR here.](https://github.com/salesforce/lwc/pull/5477)

**Section of Random Facts Relating to the Design**
* We do not need to transform call expressions within a component, this is already functional
* We are not going to implement private properties yet, just private methods 
* If we need to add private accessors (getters/setters), it would be implemented similar to private methods. For now, we are not going to implement this
* You can’t use private methods in the template, this throws a linting error parsing the template expression  

## Drawbacks
**Drawback #1:** Performance.
This design requires AST traversal twice, once to rename the private functions to regular functions & then again to re-rename them as private functions. There is performance overhead to this AST traversal. 

**Drawback #2:** Complexity to LWC Compiler. 
As with all expansions, this project adds complexity and technical debt to the LWC compiler. This project is implementing two new babel transforms that will need to be maintained. 

## Alternatives 
We have considered 4 other designs, which are explained below. 

**Alternate Design \#1:** Implement [@babel/plugin-transform-private-methods](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-private-methods). 

As you can see in the screenshot above, the linter suggests to “Please add @babel/plugin-transform-private methods to your configuration” when using private methods in an LWC. This Babel transform lets you use JavaScript private methods in environments that don’t support them yet by transforming them into older, compatible JavaScript. In our use case, the Babel transform would perform compile time validation on private properties (anything without LWC decorators, such as @wire, @api, and @track). 

This design causes issues because class properties get renamed, thus becoming unusable in the template. While this solution does remove the error, it does not resolve the security issues within the components. It is also adding a polyfill for something that is already natively supported in browsers.

**Alternate Design \#2:** Remove [@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-class-properties).

@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties is the babel transform throwing the error in LWC right now. This alternative design suggests removing this babel transform from the LWC compiler completely. This Babel transform lets you use class fields in JavaScript and transforms them into code that works in older environments. By removing this transform, we would defer to the browser to handle class properties, including \#private elements. 

The main issue with this design is that it breaks reactivity on class properties, which is a core principle of LWC. [This problem is spelled out in more detail here](https://github.com/salesforce/lwc/issues/3537). 

**Alternate Design \#3:** Add a newly created @private decorator. 

This alternative design is to introduce a new `@private` decorator for internal only components. Then use a custom babel plugin to convert `@private` annotated methods to be only accessible from within the class. This design offered the most promising path to unblocking internal teams, as well as allowing opportunities for growth to unblock external teams. However, it’s reiterating a design that is already native to JavaScript so feels repetitive. 

**Alternate Design  \#4:** Use WeakMaps. 

The final approach suggestion was to utilize WeakMaps within the internal components. This solution is a design at the component level, instead of at the compiler level. While component owners still need to migrate their LWCs once private methods are enabled, the overhead & boilerplate for the WeakMap implementation is much higher for component owners. 

## Adoption Strategy
New LWCs would need to implement their own private methods. Existing LWCs would need to migrate their existing methods to be private. We intend to create a linter to ensure consistent use of private methods when needed. 

The design spelled out above (the Trojan Horse Strategy) is backwards compatible and does not break existing LWC code. 

If 1P component owners are looking for an example of how private methods are implemented, they can look at the `ui-lightning-components` module in core. This module is owned by the Base Components team, who plan on updating all lightning components to utilize private methods. A simple example could be written for external customers.  

## How We Teach This
Internally, we are currently calling this design the “Trojan Horse Strategy”, as we are sneaking the private methods past @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties by transforming the method names. 

For external audiences, documentation should be written announcing that private methods now work in LWCs. This documentation should link to the public MDN documentation, as we are implementing native JavaScript usage. We will want to make sure to call out all similarities and differences between the LWC private methods and native ones.

## Unresolved Questions
Will this have any impact on Komachi? They have their own compiler as well.
